                        <p>Adele is known for being one of the most private celebrities, but in a new interview the Hello singer has opened up about life as a parent, her long-term partner Simon and how she has lost weight for her upcoming tour.</p>
                        <p>"[Angelo] makes me very proud of myself. When I became a parent, I felt like I was truly living. I had a purpose, where before I didn’t," the 27-year-old singer told Vogue. "I can’t have any other junk in my head to worry about as well [as him]."</p>
                        
                        <p><img src="/img/p1.jpg" class="lazyload"><p>Adele revealed how motherhood has changed her priorities</p></p>

                        <p>Opening up about her partner Simon, the songstress revealed that it was love at first sight. "When I met Simon I knew something was going to happen." The songstress also praised her boyfriend with helping her through her recovery, following surgery on her vocal cords in 2011, which included six weeks of complete silence and intensive vocal rehabilitation.</p>
                        <p>Speaking about her ground-breaking album 25, Adele says that it took her a while to get back into the song writing groove, but when she did, it taught her to look at herself differently. "I was just shocked that all of a sudden I was 25! But actually I like myself more than ever. I feel so comfortable in my own skin. I really like how I look, I like who I am, I like everyone that I surround myself with. Obviously I have insecurities but they don’t hold me </p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p2.jpg" class="lazyload">Adele has been with Simon since 2011</p>
                        
                        <p>At the end of February the singer will begin a nine-month world tour, starting in Belfast. "I’m only touring for the fans, to see the people that changed my life. There’s no need for me to tour. I’ll always be nervous, worrying whether I’m going to be good enough. And the adrenaline is so exhausting."</p>
                        <p>In preparation for the tour, Adele has had to make some lifestyle changes, including avoiding bad foods and fizzy drinks that can damage her throat. The songstress has also given up smoking. "I was trying to get some stamina for my tour so I lost a bit of weight. Now I fit into normal, off-the-shelf clothes, which is a really big problem for me!"</p>
                        <p>Adele has spoken candidly about her struggle with body image issues. The 27-year-old, who recently made a triumphant return to the spotlight with single Hello, has revealed that she tries not to let her insecurities "rule my life".</p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p3.jpg" class="lazyload"><p>Adele has spoken candidly about body image</p></p>

                        <p>"I do have body image problems, for sure," she told The Spectrum's Jenny Eliscu, ahead of the release of her new song When We Were Young. "But I don't let them rule my life, at all."</p>
                        <p>She added: "There's bigger issues going on in the world than how I might feel about myself and stuff like that."</p>
                        <p>The singer, who later this month is set to release her highly-anticipated album titled 25, went on to explain that she would prefer to be unique than "look like everyone else".</p>
                        <p>"There's only one of you, so why would you want to look like everyone else?" she said. "Why would you want to have the same hairstyle as everyone else and have the same opinions as everyone else?"</p>
                        <p><img src="/img/p4.jpg" class="lazyload"><p>Adele, pictured here at the 2013 Grammys, has returned to the spotlight</p></p>

                        <p>There's no doubt that the British singer has made a spectacular return to the spotlight after enjoying a few years away to spend more time with partner Simon Konecki and the couple's son Angelo.</p>
                        <p>The lead title, Hello, of her upcoming album rocketed to number one in the charts, selling 165,000 copies in just three days after its release. The song's accompanying video also broke the record for the most viewed video in 24 hours on Vevo, totalling more than 27.7 million views on its first day.</p>
                        <p>Adele recently?revealed the secret to her songwriting success, admitting she knows if it’s a good song based on how moved she is by her own lyrics.</p>
                        <p>"In order for me to feel confident with one of my songs it has to really move me," she told New York Times. "That's how I know that I've written a good song for myself – it's when I start crying. It's when I break out in [expletive] tears in the vocal booth or in the studio, and I'll need a moment to myself."</p>
